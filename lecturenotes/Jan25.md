# Introduction

- Videos online to assist that will be on HuskyCT. That means no lecture will be given in class.
- Each Friday will have a new module opened.
- The textbook is the Nilsson and Riedel, the videos closely follow the textbook.
- The self check quizes are not graded, but a good way to ensure video comprehension.

## Supplies
  - Textbook is vital.
  - Breadboard, Component Kit, ADALM2000.
  - Calculator necessary.
## Experiments
- Each experiment has a report due with it. 
- The format will be standard engineering style.

## Exams
- 3 Questions or so, but each will have a review and practice exam.
- The exam will be right after the review session and after the normally scheduled time on Tuesdays.
## Design Project
- Week 4 (Feb 27) we start design projects. This takes three weeks or so.
- These have their own reports also standard engineering style.

# Tips for Success
- As soon as each module opens, work your way through it at your own time.
- This course will make you question your decision to become an engineer.
- There will be a Problem Assignment due each week. Expect 6-8 problems.
- Problem Solving Assignments are going to be in class where students solve problems together.
- Experiment Reports
Read the lab handout prior to lab. You can prebuild the circuit at home.
- Design Projects
