\section{Abstract}
This lab introduces frequency domain behavior of passive filters composed of resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Through experimentation with low-pass and high-pass filters, as well as an underdamped RLC configuration, the frequency response and phase shift characteristics are observed. Emphasis is placed on understanding cutoff frequency, amplitude response, and the resonance phenomenon.

\section{Introduction}
While earlier labs focused on transient response, this experiment shifts the focus to the steady-state sinusoidal behavior of filters. The goal is to understand how the amplitude and phase of a circuitâ€™s output vary as a function of frequency. By examining first-order filters and a second-order resonant circuit, intuition is built for applications in audio electronics, communication systems, and signal processing.

Filters are circuits that selectively allow or reject certain frequencies. Low-pass filters allow low frequencies to pass while attenuating higher ones. High-pass filters do the opposite. The transition point between passing and attenuation is the cutoff frequency, defined where the output amplitude is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ of the input.

\section{Theory}
\subsection{Low-Pass RC Filter}
A first-order RC low-pass filter has the following configuration:


The transfer function is:
\[
	H(f) = \frac{1}{1 + j2\pi fRC}
\]
The cutoff frequency is given by:
\[
	f_c = \frac{1}{2\pi RC}
\]

\subsection{High-Pass RC Filter}
A high-pass RC filter simply swaps the resistor and capacitor:


The transfer function becomes:
\[
	H(f) = \frac{j2\pi fRC}{1 + j2\pi fRC}
\]
With the same cutoff frequency:
\[
	f_c = \frac{1}{2\pi RC}
\]

\subsection{Second-Order RLC Circuit (Bandpass Filter)}
An underdamped RLC circuit exhibits resonance. The circuit is:


Its transfer function peaks at:
\[
	f_0 = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}} \quad \text{(resonant frequency)}
\]
And has a quality factor $Q$:
\[
	Q = \frac{1}{R} \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}
\]

\section{Conclusion}
This lab demonstrated the role of passive filters in shaping the frequency content of signals. First-order filters showed characteristic $-20\,\mathrm{dB/decade}$ roll-off near cutoff, while the second-order RLC circuit showed clear resonant behavior. Agreement between theory, simulation, and measurement confirms the behavior of these filters and prepares students for future work in frequency-selective networks and analog signal processing.
